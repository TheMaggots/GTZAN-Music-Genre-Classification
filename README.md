# GTZAN-Music-Genre-Classification
Music. Experts have been trying for a long time to understand sound and what differentiates one song from another. How to visualize sound. What makes a tone different from another. The data contain a set of collection of 10 genres (classic, jazz, pop..) with 100 audio, and each audio corresponds to a visual representation image representation for each file so in order to build a model classifier we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to complete the task. Tools : PYTHON, Librosa, Keras.
